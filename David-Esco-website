            <p>My name is David Esco and I am a Junior at the University of Florida studying educational sciences with an emphasis on disabilities in society and a minor in educational technology. <br>
             I am from Live Oak, Florida, and my hobbies include rock climbing, cooking, reading, and tennis. <br>
             I am currently employed at Luke's New York Bagel Shop and have also volunteered at Kids Count in Alachua County. <br>
             Kids Count is an after-school program serving K-5 students of Rawlings and Metcalfe Elementary Schools in Gainesville, Florida.</p>
